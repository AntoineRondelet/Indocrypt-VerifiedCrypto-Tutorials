For F* basics, please see the tutorial at: http://fstar-lang.org/tutorial/.

Chapters 2-6 should provide basic introduction to F*. The tutorial also contains some exercises.

The exercises/ directory in the VM image is setup so that in there you can launch an emacs client and start writing your own examples.

There are also plenty of examples in the F* github repo shipped as part of the VM (FStar/examples/).

In the exercises/ directory, there are some small exercises for pure fragment, Sum.fst and stack/.

The lowstar/ directory contains small examples for Low* (VeriCrypt.LowStar.Basic.fst) and some exercises (VeriCrypt.LowStar.fst). If you do a `make` in that directory, it should verify those files, and extract C code in the exercises/lowstar/dist directory. The C code is extracted in files VeriCrypt_LowStar_Basic.c and VeriCrypt_LowStar.c respectively. You can launch those files in emacs and follow them.
